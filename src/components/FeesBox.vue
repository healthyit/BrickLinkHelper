      <h1 class="title is-1">Fee Structure</h1>
      <div class="block">We try to base our fees on the value we provide. We charge 1.5% of the value altered via our app, in USD. It's cheaper than the percent Bricklink or Paypal etc takes, for seller the enormous amount of time this saves, improved sales through optimised pricing etc - we feel this is well worth it.</div>
      <div class="block">What do we mean by altered value? Lets look at some examples:</div>
